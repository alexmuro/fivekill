Leave Me Alone is a song about finding yourself uncomfortable and overwhelmed around others, seeking isolation to resolve these feelings, and finding, once isolated, that the feelings persist because the problem is you. It’s a neurotic strut through drug-induced overconfidence in public leading to private regret later on. It’s seeing yourself as abandoned when you’ve intentionally closed yourself off. It’s believing your life is a mysterious spiraling curse of misfortune despite knowing it’s really the calculated sum of your actions and of random meaningless circumstances that are constantly changing and have nothing to do with you.
