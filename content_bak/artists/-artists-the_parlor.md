Multi-instrumentalist producer-songwriters wife and husband duo Jen O’Connor and Eric Krans are fearless in their willingness to explore new sound palettes for their intimate brand of art-pop. Throughout their progression from indie-folk, to stomp and clap trance-folk, to “campfire disco” -as Pitchfork described their sophomore release, Wahzu Wahzu -The Parlor continues to experiment with new instrumentation and blend their set of genre and stylistic songwriting influences. Their deeply personal concept record ‘Kiku’ released on April 13, 2018.
