Dead Tooth is the ethereal brainchild of Zach Ellis, formerly the mastermind of The Adventures Of The Silver Spaceman and founding drummer/singer of Brooklyn’s Haybaby. Following a series of jams with guitarist Andrew Bailey of DIIV, drummer Dylan DePice of Verite, electric violinist River Allen of Ghost Piss, and bassist Jason Smith, the group found their ability gel musically and exchange ideas fruitful enough to make the arrangement permanent. The result is the four-song EP Still Beats, recorded in a cold basement in Albany, NY in the winter of 2018. The title track features Darius VanSluytman of early-00's afropunk outfit No Surrender gutturally yelping a verse, and Sandy Davis of Pecas contributes spectral backing vocals to the songs “Spirit” and “Hungry Ghost.”
