"Sex and the city is a combination that seems great but often isn’t. This is what I’ve come to learn from the new record from geoff gordon, Sex and the City, and discussions with my girlfriend about the show its named after that I’ve never actually watched. Thankfully I’ve gleaned enough to know that we can’t stay Samanthas forever, growing out of our promiscuous ways can be hell, and the entire premise of living in New York City and caring more about who you’re going to sleep with instead of the half of your paycheck going to rent is fucking preposterous.

geoff gordon tackle all that and more on their newest collection of indie rock, a solid record about growing up, city living, and how much both can suck. Co-lead singers Shannon Straney and Dan LaFave trade off on songs, giving the album valuable variety. LaFave’s tracks lean towards self-deprecating power pop, reconciling the pains of living in a city that beats you down with the realization that your own bad habits are doing the same. Straney, meanwhile, creates subtler synthwave tracks about loss and longing. Both singers nail their respective styles, but when they come together for a rare joint harmony, their voices complement one another so well that you wish the moments were a more common occurrence." - Mixed Frequencies
