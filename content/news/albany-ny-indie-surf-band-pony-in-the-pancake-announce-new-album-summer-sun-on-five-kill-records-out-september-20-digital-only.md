### About The Album



A tear fell from The Sun and cousins Robert and Dan witnessed it fall from atop a summer mountain in a moment outside of time. Since then they have been on a quest. Wherever PIP goes, they go there with one purpose, and one purpose only. For over two decades PIP has explored The Earth under the guidance and worship of The Sun. They secluded themselves in the darkest basements of Upstate New York where they went to work channeling Joy, Sadness, and Death on a four track recorder. They derive their music directly from The Sun and write all of their songs in the moment of inspiration. They do not think. They celebrate The Sun and out comes Love. 



Over the years PIP has amassed a large and faithful following in and around the Northeast. They have played shows to packed houses all along the East Coast and Canada. There live sound is a psychedelic juggernaut. "Anyone who's had the pleasure of witnessing their live show has felt the sweet spot where the propulsion of the Velvet Underground, the wide-eyed romanticism and surf twang of the Beach Boys and the elliptical grooves of Krautrock intersect." (Jeremy Schwartz, Chronogram Magazine).



On Summer Sun PIP is a four piece consisting of Robert Flynn - (Lead Guitar and Vocals), Daniel Prockup - (Drums and Vocals), Benjamin Garrett - (Lead Guitar, Rhythm Guitar, Vocals), and Bob Forget - (Bass and Angelic Vocals). Rick Spataro of Onlyness/Florist produced Summer Sun.



### Singles



Summer Has a Way: Summer has a way. It does. It sets you apart from other seasons. Summer is Majesty.  It reminds you that perfection exists.  It has a way. But that, you already know.  You wish you could capture that moment forever.  The Moon sets.  The Music dies.  The Waves crash.  The Sun Shines. Summer.  It lets you know.  



No Place for A Flower: I was in love in my younger years, home from college for Thanksgiving.  I had fallen in love the past summer, but the object of my affection left my heart broken, shattered in pieces as we went off to different schools.  I, alone and crying.  She, happy and smiling.  On the night before Thanksgiving I left a single flower in a small vase on the doorstep of her family home, where she was for the brief holiday break as well.  I figured she would see it, know its implication, and rush to my arms where we would melt together in a loving eternity.  It was not so.  The flower remained on her doorstep night after night.  It died.  And so did our love.  In the end, I felt bad for the flower more than myself. Maybe our love never had a chance, but the flower did not have to die.  The cold, cold night is no place for a flower.  It’s getting cold outside again.  This is a song about the cruel world we live in.  We hope you enjoy it.  



Waiting for Love: Everyday I wake up and leave my apartment I have one goal, and one goal only.  To find Love.  Everywhere I go, every walk I take, every pond I sit by, I go with the hopes of finding love.  I know that love is out there.  It is just a matter of time until until my destiny is realized.  In the meantime, I just wait.  And wait.  And wait.  I will continue to wait.  Under the moon.  Under the stars.  Under the Sun.  This song goes out to everyone.  Everyone who is waiting for love.  If you are waiting, this song is for you.  It is your song.
