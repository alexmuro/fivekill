Five Kill Records is a not-for profit independent record label based out of New York’s Capital Region. Named after the confluence of five kills (rivers) where Albany was first settled as a Dutch colony—Rutten Kill, Vosen Kill, Beaver Kill, Normans Kill and Patroon Creek—the label itself is a confluence of five Albany/Troy-area professional and DIY recording collectives and labels: B3nson Recording Company, Swordpaw Collective, Collar City Records, The Rev Records, and Bee Side Cassettes.

Five Kill is a community of like-minded creators who love heartfelt, inspiring music. It is an artist-friendly label run by musicians, artists, producers, engineers, promoters, house-show operators, editors, and videographers. The label’s aim is to support musicians and aid in developing their careers by providing ideas, support and access to music industry services to enrich the region’s creative economy. Fivekill is a not for profit record label reinvesting its income back into services for artists.

Over the past 10 years Five Kill members have released over 200 albums, created and produced a music festival (Restoration Festival) which featured Mount Erie, Man Man, Sharon Van Etten, Deer Tick, and Titus Andronicus, produced online video content for major-label artists, placed recorded material with larger publishing platforms, and created content that has been featured in The New York Times, NPR, Pitchfork, KEXP, Bandcamp Weekly, and Uproxx.

The first release from Five Kill is The Parlor’s third LP, Kiku, out on April 13th, with forthcoming releases from Rechorduroys, Onlyness (Rick Spataro of Florist), Bear Grass, and Neighborhood of Make Believe.
