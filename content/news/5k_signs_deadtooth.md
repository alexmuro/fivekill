Five Kill Records is please to announce we have signed the bands Dead Tooth and will be releasing the EP Still Beats on Septemeber 26th.

Dead Tooth is the ethereal brainchild of Zach Ellis, formerly the mastermind of The Adventures Of The Silver Spaceman and founding drummer/singer of Brooklynâ€™s Haybaby. Following a series of jams with guitarist Andrew Bailey of DIIV, drummer Dylan DePice of Verite, electric violinist River Allen of Ghost Piss, and bassist Jason Smith, the group found their ability gel musically and exchange ideas fruitful enough to make the arrangement permanent. The result is the four-song EP Still Beats, recorded in a cold basement in Albany, NY in the winter of 2018.
