Unawake reflects on the inability to truly understand what others are thinking. Frustration in the idea that we can know someone so closely, though never hear the thoughts that run through their mind. Never receive a true image of what they are thinking, how they feel, or the way they behave in solitude. Our minds often race with questions, dreams, blurred reality, and many of those thoughts may never be heard. Those which we wish to share, may never be perceived the way we wished they would. We have to trust that the gestures, looks, and actions of the individual fill in the picture, and instinctively determine that the words people decide to share are true.
