The Abyssmals present … ‘Gospels, Hymns, and Other Trash!’

On their very first full band album, The Abyssmals have refined this fuzzed out collection of psychedelic garage rock songs and filtered them through their unique kaleidoscopic lens. Sonically, the album unfolds like a Quentin Tarantino soundtrack to The Twilight Zone. 

Recorded in the Fall of 2018 at good friend Shane Williams’ basement (aka The Mansion of Happenings), the band set out to capture the raw and powerful sound they’d developed as a five piece performing songs previously released on their Self-Titled 2016 demo, as well as new and unreleased material.  

’Gospels, Hymns and Other Trash!’ takes The Abyssmals’ garage grit on a journey through surf, blues, shoegaze, punk and soul in a calculated whirlwind.  Drummer Nick Nigro propels the record with thunderous backbeats working in fine order with the Motown-on-LSD grooves of bassist, Boris Cahrenger.  Guitarist Bob Forget crafts snarling riffs and intricate, encompassing sonic textures that will obliterate your ego.  Multi-instrumentalist/percussionist, Muffy Reyes, evokes a psychedelic gospel on organs and synthesizers, all the while leading the sermon with the jangle of the tambourine.  Vocalist and guitarist Jarpon Reyes croons and hollers addressing themes of isolation, disillusionment, obsession, and escapism but always with tongue firmly in cheek.

Like The Twilight Zone, The Abyssmals exist firmly in a world between worlds; a dimension of their own imagination.  ‘Gospels, Hymns and Other Trash!’ is a stereophonic invitation to step out of your existence and into the abyss.
