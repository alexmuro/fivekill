The four-song EP Still Beats was recorded in a cold basement in Albany, NY in the winter of 2018. The title track features Darius VanSluytman of early-00's afropunk outfit No Surrender gutturally yelping a verse, and Sandy Davis of Pecas contributes spectral backing vocals to the songs “Spirit” and “Hungry Ghost".
