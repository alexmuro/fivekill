“Woods Come Find Me” concerns the end of a transition for Albany psych-folk outfit Bruiser & Bicycle as they evolved from a full rock band to a two-piece. Like waking up in an unfamiliar bed, only to find that the bed is in a forest clearing bathed in soft light, the record spends its brief span fighting hypnagogia and other forms of transitional disorientation by wrestling with suspended animation, arrested development, and unrested spirits. Both members share vocal duties and swap instrumental roles throughout, recalling a more exploratory era of indie rock that wasn’t afraid to add electronic embellishments in its approach of full folk freak-outs.
