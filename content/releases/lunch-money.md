Lunch Money was recorded over three days in an upstate cabin during March 2018. Produced by Ryan Slowey (Tree Walker Audio, Maggot Brain) with engineering by Craig Dutra (White Lodge Audio, Aficionado), the album was tracked live with virtually everything piped through a vintage Roland Space Echo for that timeless UFO hover. Victoria Rutledge and Anna Lazarou were abducted for vocal support. Deep in the delay chain, the band made first contact with a disincarnate intelligence, entrapping them in a cosmic Ponzi scheme. Lunch Money is the groupâ€™s attempt to pay off their debt, and maybe get a bite to eat. Either way, the portal is open.
