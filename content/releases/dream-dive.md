During the recording of last year’s release Kiku, The Parlor wrote a few songs that felt like outliers. Kiku was a tightly wound concept album but “Dream” and “Dive” were both pointing toward the other side of grief. “Dream” held in it the realization of the couple’s tight bond, a glimpse of a blissful moment in an otherwise dark epoch. “Dive” is the seductive siren song. Ethereal harmonies, sweet distorted darkness over synth bass, atmospheric electric guitars, driving drums, a darkpop band with a dreamy desert witch vocalist. "Dream" premiered on Atwood Magazine 7/26 (http://atwoodmagazine.com/tprd-dream-the-parlor/), and was on Apple Music's Best New Pop playlist. "Dive" premiered in Flaunt 8/15 (https://www.flaunt.com/content/the-parlor-dive), and was song of the day on Austin's KUTX on 8/21 (https://kutx.org/song-of-the-day/the-parlor-dive)
