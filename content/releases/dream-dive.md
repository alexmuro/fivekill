During the recording of last year’s release Kiku, The Parlor wrote a few songs that felt like outliers. Kiku was a tightly wound concept album about the couple’s multiple miscarriages, but “Dream” and “Dive” were both pointing toward the other side of that grief. “Dream” held in it the realization of the couple’s tight bond, a glimpse of a blissful moment in an otherwise dark epoch. “Dive” was the fuck you. The feeling that it’s all too much. It became clear that the band was now free to write their own rules. Maybe they’d change it all up. Become a heavy desert rock band. Or buy motorcycles. Shave their heads and sell everything. Oh nevermind. It doesn't matter after all.
