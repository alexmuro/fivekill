BURLY is a 5-piece band based in Upstate New York. Born out of an email correspondence between Ryan Stewart and Timothy Furgal in 2013 and the end of several bands, BURLY consists of Stewart (vibraphone and vocals,) along with Richard Nolan (guitar,) Seth Tillinghast (drums,) Ian Nichols (bass,) and Adam Muro (tenor saxophone.) The evocative and rococo poetry of Stewart and Furgal blends into the dynamic flood of the band, providing a unique experience. The vibraphone is a large, keyboard-like percussion instrument common to jazz music (the band insisted this information be included).
