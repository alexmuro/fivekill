Onlyness is the new project solo project of Rick Spataro. Spataro formerly performed solo as the Firs, and played and produced in Florist, a collaborative effort between Spataro, multi-instrumentalist Jonnie Baker and the band’s songwriter, Emily Sprague. To anyone familiar with those works, the tonal palette will come as no surprise. Soft pillowy snare drum and muted bass guitar contrasts with layers of vocals, electric and acoustic guitar, upright piano, analog synthesizers and other electronics. Spataro’s approach to writing his own songs emphasizes melody and lyric, with a production and orchestration style that aims to support the underlying song, rather than dress it up or drown it out. The words are plain and direct, equal parts sarcastic and sincere. Certain songs sound at home next to the any of the country and Americana music that New York’s Hudson Valley is known for, while others lean more toward woody, vintage pop or depraved alt-rock. 

Onlyness's debut self-titled album will be out this summer.
