Bear Grass was conceived as a solo project for singer/songwriter Katie Hammon, then of the band Slender Shoulders, releasing her first album "In The Light" on B3nson Records in 2011. In the fall of 2012, Katie was invited to play at Albany's annual Harvest Festival. Ian White, Mitch Masterson and Stephen Stanley rounded out Bear Grass "the band" for the inaugural performance. 

Tommy Krebs joined in 2013 following the first full-band recording, "Stories in Books," a joint B3nson/Swordpaw release. In fall 2014 Masterson decided to pursue other ventures, and August Sagehorn joined for a Northeast tour. Stanley moved to New Orleans in early 2015, and Krebs took over guitar full-time. 

Bear Grass has performed across the East coast since 2013 and is excited to release their sophomore album "LEFT", recorded at Business District Recording with Hunter Davidsohn and mastered by Josh Bonati. The new album is slated to release in Fall 2018.
