Rechorduroys formed just over two years ago, shortly after the dissolution of Garrett’s previous band Party Boat and a relocation to Troy, NY. The band has perfected its sound over the last few years while playing dates throughout the Northeast. With only one previous release, the 2016 single “Honeybee”, their forthcoming self-titled album has been a long time in the works. The time spent has resulted in a collection of well crafted songs that feel as nostalgic as they do new.
