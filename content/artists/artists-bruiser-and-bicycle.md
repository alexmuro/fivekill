In its brief 2-year existence, Bruiser & Bicycle has already gone through more sonic permutations than most bands go through in their whole life cycle. The driving force throughout has remained the mindful, expressionist songwriting of core members Nick Whittemore and Keegan Graziane. First they were a peckish post-punk basement-core group with dark undertones and synesthetic lyrics. This iteration generated positive press and audience response to their debut LP, “You’re All Invited.” Membership shuffles pared the group down to the core duo, who shed their original persona by hunkering down in Philadelphia’s Headroom Studio to create an 8.5-minute song suite of warped chamber pop called “Turn to Dirt,” featuring forays into synthesis and string textures from Alex G collaborator Molly Germer. In an additional mischievous act, they elected to release this track as the B-side to a split with Albany “tweemo-punk” mainstays Hate Club, further enhancing the dramatic genre contrast of their departure into the unknown.
