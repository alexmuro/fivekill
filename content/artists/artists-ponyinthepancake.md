Over the years PIP has amassed a large and faithful following in and around the Northeast. They have played shows to packed houses all along the East Coast and Canada. There live sound is a psychedelic juggernaut. "Anyone who's had the pleasure of witnessing their live show has felt the sweet spot where the propulsion of the Velvet Underground, the wide-eyed romanticism and surf twang of the Beach Boys and the elliptical grooves of Krautrock intersect." (Jeremy Schwartz, Chronogram Magazine).

PIP is a four piece consisting of Robert Flynn - (Lead Guitar and Vocals), Daniel Prockup - (Drums and Vocals), Benjamin Garrett - (Lead Guitar, Rhythm Guitar, Vocals), and Bob Forget - (Bass and Angelic Vocals). Rick Spataro of Onlyness/Florist produced Summer Sun.
